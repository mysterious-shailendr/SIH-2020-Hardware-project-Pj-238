Smart India Hackathon 2020 Hardware Edition<br/>
Our team worked on a hardware problem, no: PJ-238<br/>
We have made it to the finals, We came 1st runner up
## Problem statement description: 
  Cost effective innovative solution for long distanch (3 to 8 kms) wireless (LAN) Broadband
  Connectivity to sparsely located individual households in rural areas (Last mile Connectivity)
  from Fram Panchayat (USO) ONT locations. Under Bharat Net project of Deptt. Of Telecom,
  fibres have reached to more than a lakh of Gram Panchayats. But extending broadband
  connectivity from these Gram Panchayat ONTs to individual households located at a distance of
  3 to 8 km is a problem. Extending fibre to individual houses is expensive, messy and very
  difficult to maintain in far flung rural areas. WiFi connectivity has short range problem. Benefits:
  It can offer a cost effective solution to last mile broadband connectivity [problem, which will
  facilitate greater broadband penetration to rural population. It will ensure the proper utilization of
  USOF Bharat Net fibre and also help in bridging the Digital Divide to a greater extent.
